[Verse 1]
How long, how long ’til I’m no longer a shadow
‘Cause I’ve been thinking I’d so love to feel again
Silence; I screamed her name
And wondered why you never came
I wear my, I wear my curse you wear my cure

[Pre-Chorus]
(I feel destined)
I never thought I’d be this way
(For disaster)
Without you I’d just fade away

[Chorus 1]
Please see in me what I can’t see
I’m begging
Please won’t you be the light I need so desperately
